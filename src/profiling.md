# Profiling

When optimizing a program, you also need a way to determine which parts of the
program are "hot" (executed frequently enough to affect runtime) and worth
modifying. This is best done via profiling.

## Profilers

There are many different profilers available, each with their strengths and
weaknesses. The following profilers have been used successfully on Rust
programs.
- [perf] is a general-purpose profiler that uses hardware performance counters.
  [Hotspot] and [Firefox Profiler] are good for viewing data recorded by perf.
  It works on Linux.
- [AMD μProf] is a general-purpose profiler. It works on Windows and Linux.
- [flamegraph] is a Cargo command that uses perf/DTrace to profile your
  code and then displays the results in a flame graph. It works on Linux and
  all platforms that support DTrace (macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and possibly
  Windows).
- [Cachegrind] & [Callgrind] give global, per-function, and per-source-line
  instruction counts and simulated cache and branch prediction data. They work
  on Linux and some other Unixes.
- [DHAT] is good for finding which parts of the code are causing a lot of
  allocations, and for giving insight into peak memory usage. It can also be
  used to identify hot calls to `memcpy`. It works on Linux and some other
  Unixes. [dhat-rs] is an experimental alternative that is a little less
  powerful and requires minor changes to your Rust program, but works on all
  platforms.
- [heaptrack] is another heap profiling tool. It works on Linux.
- [`counts`] supports ad hoc profiling, which combines the use of `eprintln!`
  statement with frequency-based post-processing, which is good for getting
  domain-specific insights into parts of your code. It works on all platforms.
- [Coz] performs *causal profiling* to measure optimization potential, and has
  Rust support via [coz-rs]. It works on Linux.

## Debug Info

To profile a release build effectively you might need to enable source line
debug info. To do this, add the following lines to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[profile.release]
debug = 1
```
See the [Cargo documentation] for more details about the `debug` setting.

[Cargo documentation]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug

Unfortunately, even after doing the above step you won't get detailed profiling
information for standard library code. This is because shipped versions of the
Rust standard library are not built with debug info. To remedy this, you can
build your own version of the compiler and standard library, following [these
instructions], and adding the following lines to the `config.toml` file:
 ```toml
[rust]
debuginfo-level = 1
```
This is a hassle, but may be worth the effort in some cases.

## Symbol Demangling

Rust uses a mangling scheme to encode function names in compiled code. If a
profiler is unaware of this scheme, its output may contain symbol names like
`_ZN3foo3barE` or `_ZN28_$u7b$$u7b$closure$u7d$$u7d$E` or
`_ZN88_$LT$core..result..Result$LT$$u21$$C$$u20$E$GT$$u20$as$u20$std..process..Termination$GT$6report17hfc41d0da4a40b3e8E`.
Names like these can be manually demangled using [`rustfilt`].
